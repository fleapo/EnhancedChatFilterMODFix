About
-----

The original project is here: http://bbs.ngacn.cc/read.php?tid=7527032 by szpunk, which is abondoned.<br />
However in 6.2.4 patch, some APIs have been removed. so I decided to fix those errors.<br />
原项目见http://bbs.ngacn.cc/read.php?tid=7527032，作者为szpunk。<br />
由于原作者不再更新，而且6.2.4的补丁中更改了部分API，所以我把修复过的放在这里。<br />

Please notice that I am not a lua programmer, there won't be code improments.<br />
If you wants to help or make a english version, feel free to create issues. ^_^<br />
请注意：我不会lua！应该不会有本质上的代码更新。<br />

FAQ

1. Why there isn't an internal blacklist?<br />
Well, times change, no need for that.

2. How to filter those low level users?<br />
There is no derict API. There are other ways though, but the original author didn't write this part.

3. Why you write this page in english and this addon in Chinese?<br />
Goood question! I just don't how to write a mutilanguage addon. Maybe you can help?
